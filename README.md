# Module-5-Daily-Planner

## Description

This project was created to help navigate the hustle and bustle of the everchanging business day by allowing you to log your tasks or meetings for the day in different timeslots while tracking when your time window has passed as well. While a usual planner tracks weeks or even years, this daily planner has slots for all the hours during a regular business day. The user can leave this application open in a window for them to come back to and check their schedule or edit their plans as they see fit.
